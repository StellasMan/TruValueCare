                <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
                <p>
                    I’m Ngozi Kalu, PMHNP-BC, AGNP-C, a board-certified psychiatric nurse practitioner serving clients across Texas. I provide 
                    compassionate, evidence-based mental health care for adults and teens, helping them regain balance and confidence in their 
                    daily lives. I specialize in treating anxiety, depression, ADHD, trauma, and sleep disorders, and other mental health disorders. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also work closely with patients and their families to create treatment plans that fit their unique goals. My approach combines 
                    thorough psychiatric evaluations, medication management, and supportive counseling to help you feel better, think clearly, 
                    and live with purpose. Many of my patients come to me when life feels overwhelming, relationships are strained, or focus and 
                    motivation seem out of reach. Together, we identify what’s getting in the way and build a clear, personalized path forward.
                    I believe healing happens when care is collaborative, respectful, and accessible. That’s why I offer <b>flexible scheduling and 
                    accept insurance through Headway</b> so you can get started without delay.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>If you’re ready to take the next step, I’d be honored to partner with you in your journey toward wellness.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>What is your approach to providing care?</b><br>
                    Interpersonal relationships with each patient. Active listening to each patient's concerns and working with the patient 
                    as a team to provide the required treatment and care. And also the continuity of care.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>What can clients expect from their first session with you?</b><br>
                    Each client should expect to take away from each session with me, knowing that I have their best interest at heart, and 
                    trust that I am always willing to work with them to get the best outcome.
                </p>

                <h2><b>Education</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Ngozi holds a Post-Graduate Certificate in Psychiatric/Mental Health Nursing from Wilkes University, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. 
                    She earned her Master of Science in Nursing as an Adult-Geriatric Nurse Practitioner from the University of Texas Health Science 
                    Center in Houston, Texas, and her Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the University of Texas at Arlington. She also obtained her 
                    Associate Degree in Nursing from Lone Star College, Cypress, Texas. In addition to her clinical training, Ngozi holds a 
                    Graduate Certificate in Human Resources Management and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Westminster College 
                    in Salt Lake City, Utah, which strengthens her leadership, organizational, and patient&#8209;centered care delivery skills.
                </p>
                
                <h2><b>Personal Life</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of her professional life, Ngozi enjoys taking morning walks with her husband and spending quality time with her family. 
                    She values balance, wellness, and meaningful connections&#8209;principles that also guide her approach to patient care.
