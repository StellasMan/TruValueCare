                <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
                <p>
                    I am Ngozi Kalu, PMHNP-BC, AGNP-C, a board-certified psychiatric nurse practitioner serving clients across Texas. I provide 
                    compassionate, evidence-based mental health care for adults and teens, helping them regain balance and confidence in their 
                    daily lives. I specialize in treating anxiety, depression, ADHD, trauma, and sleep disorders, and other mental health disorders. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also work closely with patients and their families to create treatment plans that fit their unique goals. My approach combines 
                    thorough psychiatric evaluations, medication management, and supportive counseling to help you feel better, think clearly, 
                    and live with purpose. Many of my patients come to me when life feels overwhelming, relationships are strained, or focus and 
                    motivation seem out of reach. Together, we identify what is getting in the way and build a clear, personalized path forward.
                    I believe healing happens when care is collaborative, respectful, and accessible. That is why I offer <b>flexible scheduling and 
                    accept insurance through Headway</b> so you can get started without delay.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>If you are ready to take the next step, I would be honored to partner with you in your journey toward wellness.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>What is your approach to providing care?</b><br>
                    My goal is to provide interpersonal relationships with each patient. I make it a priority to engage in actively 
                    listening to each patient's concerns and working with the patient as a team to provide the required treatment and care. 
                    I also empathize the importance of the continuity of care.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>What can clients expect from their first session with you?</b><br>
                    Each client should expect to take away from each session with me the knowledge that I have their best interest at heart, and 
                    trust that I am always willing to work with them to get the best possible outcome.
                </p>
