                        Ngozi Kalu, PMHNP-BC, AGNP-C, is a board-certified Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner 
                        and Adult-Geriatric Nurse Practitioner with over 15 years of extensive clinical experience. 
                        She is dedicated to delivering compassionate, evidence-based care that supports individuals 
                        in achieving emotional stability, improved daily functioning, and long-term wellbeing.

                        Ngozi has spent a significant portion of her career caring for the adult and geriatric population, 
                        including individuals living with chronic medical conditions, cognitive decline, and age-related 
                        mental health challenges. Families and caregivers consistently value her calming approach, 
                        her respect for dignity in aging, and her commitment to improving quality of life.

                        trust are foundational to care. She specializes in the treatment of various medical conditions, 
                        such as hypertension, diabetes, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and trauma-related disorders.  
                        Through personalized treatment planning, she ensures that both patients and families play an

                        thoughtful medication management, and supportive counseling, tailored to meet each person’s 
                        unique needs, goals, and level of independence. She believes that true healing happens when 
                        care is accessible, respectful, and grounded in partnership.
